# LSSD Court Services Bureau - Master Index Generator

Instantly generate a BBCode master index table of all court threads (with status, filtering, and copy-to-clipboard) for the LSSD Court Process Tracking forums.

---

## How it works

This [userscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) adds a "Generate & Copy Court Index" button to the LSSD Court Process Tracking forum pages. When clicked, it automatically scrapes all court thread data (including pagination), extracts docket numbers, statuses (with color coding), types, subjects, dates, and assigned deputies, and generates a BBCode table. The script can also auto-update the master index post for you.
